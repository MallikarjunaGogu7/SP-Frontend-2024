    <!-- Short quotation -->
    <p>Here is a short quotation: <q>To be, or not to be, that is the question.</q> — William Shakespeare</p>

    <!-- Long quotation -->
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life, a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory."
        </p>
        <footer>— Franklin D. Roosevelt, <cite>First Inaugural Address</cite></footer>
